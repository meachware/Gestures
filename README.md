#SpriteBuilder Gestures - Swipe to Angle

This is an example of using UIGestureRecognizers (Pan and Tap) to set the rotation (angle) of a sprite and toggle a setting.

I made this because I needed to test this type of controls for a space ship game. I wanted to swipe a direction and have my ship fly in the same direction along with using one and two-taps to toggle off/on the throttle.

Remember to publish this in SpriteBuilder before running in Xcode :)

**Notes:**

Iâ€™ve found it very helpful after working through a tough or challenging problem to create a test case to reinforce the information learned. That would be the rationale for this project :)
